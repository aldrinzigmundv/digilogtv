## What is Digilog TV?

A free and open-source TV news app, inspired by Linux Mint's Hypnotix.

The app features English news channels from all around the world, sourced from Free-TV/IPTV on GitHub, just like Hypnotix, to ensure that it only includes free, legal and publicly available content.

For news channel suggestions, please file an issue on both Free-TV/IPTV and our GitHub repo. I'll include suggested news channels that meet our criteria as soon as Free-TV/IPTV adds them to their list.

## Features
* Free and open-source
* Intuitive and easy-to-navigate interface design
* Offers a diverse selection of global news channels
* Convenient favorites list for quick access to your preferred channels
* Includes only free, legal, and publicly available content
* Non-disruptive ads (Play Store version only) to support future development plans
